# ðŸ§© Java Singleton Prototype â€” Singleton Pattern Approaches â€¢ (Archived)

<br>

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is a **Java prototype** created to explore and compare different approaches to implementing the **Singleton design pattern**.  
It includes:
- âœ… A **Bill Pugh** style static holder implementation  
- âœ… An **enum-based** Singleton implementation  
Both patterns are demonstrated through simple service classes and a shared logger instance, following examples from **AkÄ±n KaldÄ±roÄŸluâ€™s Design Patterns** course on Udemy.
In modern systems, this problem is typically addressed at the **dependency injection (DI) level**, making explicit singleton implementations less common in real-world applications.
